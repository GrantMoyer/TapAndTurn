## Introduction
**Tap'n'Turn** is a small utility that has been created to help you to manage your screen orientation. Android offers you two options: *lock* or *auto rotate*. Depending on your usage, that might be sufficient. However, there are usecases, when auto-rotation kicks in in the wrong moment, for example when lying horizontally in your bed. Disabling auto rotation altogether doesn't work for showing fotos to your relatives.

**Tap'n'Turn** aims to solve this problem by asking you directly when you physically rotate your device, if your intention is to change the logical screen orientation as well. It does so by displaying a little unintrusive icon in one of the corners which you can click to match the logical screen orientation to the physical screen orientation.
