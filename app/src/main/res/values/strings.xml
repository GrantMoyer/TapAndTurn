    <string name="introduction">Tap \'n\' Turn should be run with auto-rotation enabled. It will enforce the user selected orientation by drawing an invisible overlay over the screen. That is why it needs that permission. However: this overlay is keeping you from using restricted buttons, such as the "Install" button when installing apps. This is a sensible standard behavior of Android and cannot be altered. However, you can disable the screen overlay temporarily by touching the notification.</string>
